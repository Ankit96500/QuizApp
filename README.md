## Features:
- This quiz app uses the Open Trivia API to generate random quizzes.
- Each user is allowed a maximum of two attempts to take the quiz.
- If a user tries to register again with an existing email after reaching the attempt limit, access is denied.
- However, if the admin explicitly deletes the user from the system, they are allowed to take the quiz again.
- The Admin Home Page displays the user's name, score, number of attempts, and provides a delete button for each user.
